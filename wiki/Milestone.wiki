      * Setup breadboard (3/19/09)
         * Talk to George about getting a PCB
      * PCB drawings sent in (3/20/09)
      * Sensor readings - send and put into luminary (3/19/09)
         * Non-real time done, still working on real-time to allow PID gain value changes
      * Final flight prep - possibly flying (3/19/09)  
      * Stand done (3/20/09)
         * DONE 

   * Week 6 - Spring Break - research! (3/21/09-3/29/09)
      * Mixing - Matrix to convert servo inputs to controller inputs
         * Terry, Emily
      * Control Scheme - start with PID(Feedback system) and dynamics model
         * Keaton, Vivian, Jason
      * Interface with GPS - waypoints/google earth - magnetometer
         * Jason, Emily, Terry
     * Extended Kalman filter
         * Keaton, Vivian
     * Mount PCB Board (3/25/09) - evening
   
   * Week 5  
      * Mount PCB board again if didn't work - (3/31/09)
      * Email mentors to show up Thursday (3/31/09)
      * Mixing (3/31/09)
         * Have a rough one done
      * Mixing Cont (4/1/09) - only if we didn't finish
      * Control (4/2/09) - start at 3:30pm
         * Remember to include failsafe
         * Have a basic PID control implemented for a sloppy hover
      * Control Cont (4/4/09) possibly (4/5/09)

   * Week 4 - (4/6/09)
      * Control cont
      * Kalman Filter

   * Week 3 - (4/13/09)
      * Control cont.
      * Video
      * If reliable hover - start waypoints

   * Week 2 - (4/20/09)
      * Buffer of 2 weeks - everything we don't get done goes here!
