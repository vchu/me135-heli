  *Got the new charger in so we could fly the helicopter attached to the stand.
  *Helicopter needs more calibration (yaw servo)because the it keeps on spinning in circles to the right. Needs more manual trimming.

  *Friction between the floor and the test stand is too great to allow movement—need to install wheels into the test stand.
