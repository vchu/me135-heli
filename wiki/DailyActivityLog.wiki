#summary Project Progress

  * Got the new charger in so we could fly the helicopter attached to the stand.
    * Helicopter needs more calibration (yaw servo)because the it keeps on spinning in circles to the right. Needs more manual trimming.
    * The spinning in the helicopter wound up the string in test stand, making it difficult for vertical movement—keep in mind while flying
    * Friction between the floor and the test stand is too great to allow movement—need to install wheels into the test stand.
  * Continuing to work on real-time bluetooth implementation.

==4/2/09==
Figured out how to make local variables :)


==2/24/09==
  * Had a giant meeting with lots of mentors: Nimbus, George, Wenchao
    * discussed current project, scope, parts, recording flight data, using the Kalman filter
    * got to see Nimbus’s research lab – he is also working on rc helicopters but more for tracking helicopter movement with leds and cameras


==2/16-17/09==
  * possibility of competing in a UAV competition
  * slides completed, presenting on the 17th

==2/10/09==
  * Finished final version of project proposal
    * Group 8 is now SPARROW (Stable Pitch Aerobatics Research for Remotely Operated Whirlybird)
  * Microcontrollers and IMU have been ordered

==2/5/09==
  * After some discussion after class, we have an updated goal—The helicopter will now have an on-board autopilot, IMU (sensors for acceleration, tilt, and rotation), camera, and DGPS.From the ground-based computer we will pick where we want the helicopter to go on a map.  The computer will calculate a path for the helicopter to follow.  Once we click 'GO' the helicopter will travel to the chosen destinations.  The on-board camera will allow it to avoid objects during its flight.
    * that is--no aerobatic maneuvers
    * Will need to get the larger helicopter
    * need to change the microcontroller? And types of cameras?
  * Contacted Trung for help with project, camera and micro controller questions
    * should NOT stream video on bluetooth, use separate method (ex. Wifi)


==2/3/09==
Listing a few things to research
  # type of control scheme (proportional?)
  # signal conditioning (what types of filters are needed? effects?)
  # power supply filters (needed for micro controller and sensors? sizes?)
  # do we have enough digital/analog IO's?
  # is bluetooth fast enough for video feed? type of camera?
  # How do RC signals work? same as blue tooth?
  # possible aerobatic maneuvers?
