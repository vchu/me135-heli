  * Got the new charger in so we could fly the helicopter attached to the stand.
  * Helicopter needs more calibration (yaw servo)because the it keeps on spinning in circles to the right. Needs more manual trimming.
  * The spinning in the helicopter wound up the string in test stand, making it difficult for vertical movement—keep in mind while flying
  * Friction between the floor and the test stand is too great to allow movement—need to install wheels into the test stand.

Figured out how to make local variables :)

  * After some discussion after class, we have an updated goal—The helicopter will now have an on-board autopilot, IMU (sensors for acceleration, tilt, and rotation), camera, and DGPS.From the ground-based computer we will pick where we want the helicopter to go on a map.  The computer will calculate a path for the helicopter to follow.  Once we click 'GO' the helicopter will travel to the chosen destinations.  The on-board camera will allow it to avoid objects during its flight.
    * that is--no aerobatic maneuvers
    * Will need to get the larger helicopter
    * need to change the microcontroller? And types of cameras?

Listing a few things to research
  # type of control scheme (proportional?)
  # signal conditioning (what types of filters are needed? effects?)
  # power supply filters (needed for micro controller and sensors? sizes?)
  # do we have enough digital/analog IO's?
  # is bluetooth fast enough for video feed? type of camera?
  # How do RC signals work? same as blue tooth?
  # possible aerobatic maneuvers?
